This is a simple emulator of the 6502 8-bit CPU which was very popular
in the 1980's.  This CPU is found in popular home computers of that
time like the Apple II, Commodore VIC-20 and C-64, Atari XL 600/800.

This emulator was a fun project to teach how CPUs work, i.e. how it
executes the machine opcode your assembler generates from assembly
language input.  Therefore, the aim is for the code to be very simple
and readable.  Execution speed is only a very minor goal.  Actual 6502
programs that do not depend on timing, interrupts, or additional
hardware should run correctly and produce correct results.  However,
the implementation of decimal (BCD) add and subtract instructions is
currently missing.
